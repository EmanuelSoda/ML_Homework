# ML_Homework
This is an Homework for Machine Learning course of **Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics** master degree at POLIMI and UNIMI.

The aim of this project is to create a classifier able to classify type of mice according to their protein expression. Moreover in the test set the expression of a protein is lost, we use a regression model in order to try to infer its value from the value on the training set.
